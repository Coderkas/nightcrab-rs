# TUI for displaying weapon data for Elden Ring Nightreign

Originally built this because I wanted a weapons list that I can filter by
scaling and to build something in Rust.

Requires grim and tesseract for OCR-ing weapon names in-game.

Variables to set:\
NIGHTCRAB_SOURCE: to get the data from a certain game analytics provider.\
NIGHTCRAB_UPPER and NIGHTCRAB_LOWER: the screen area which contain the name of
your currently equipped weapon name and the new weapon name respectively.
